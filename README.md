# Mental Intake Assistant (MIA)
MIA is an application that should reduce the burden on professionals in the field of the mental healthcare. 
MIA can assist in doing a mental intake conversation, by asking the client questions and giving some advice based on the client's responses.
This program was developed for Amazon Alexa as a conversational platform. Using the Amazon Alexa's Skills Kit, combined with Amazon WebServices as codebase, a conversation with multiple branches was made possible.

The archive of the original working repository is private due to the access tokens present in the code, thus we created a new one. If you want to see the original working code, contact us.
