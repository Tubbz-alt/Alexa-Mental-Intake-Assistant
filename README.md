# Mental Intake Assistant (MIA)
MIA is an application that should reduce the burden on professionals in the field of the mental healthcare. 
MIA can assist in taking a mental intake conversation, by asking the cliënt some questions, and gives some small advices based on the cliënts responses.
This program was developed for the Amazon Alexa as a conversational platform. Using the Amazon Alexa's skilkit, combined with Amazon WebServices as codebase, a conversation with multiple branches was made possible.

In the archive of the original repository were some acces keys for the application, so we created a new one. If you want to see that code, contact us.
